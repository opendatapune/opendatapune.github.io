## Getting Started with lab's terminal
- Start it up in ubuntu. (Prefer windows? You're on your own!) You should see a "opendatapune" zip file or folder in your home folder. If it's a zip file, extract it to home folder so that the path is ~/opendatapune

### Getting Internet working
- If you're not from COEP, ask a COEP student on your team to put in their credentials to get the internet working.

### Working in python 3
- If you're planning to work with python 3, then this `opendatapune` folder contains most of the packages you'll need as a virtual environment. You can activate it in your terminal by the command:  
```
source ~/opendatapune/bin/activate
```
- Now in that terminal you can install packages via `pip install package` - this wasn't possible in the default system environment. But we have most packages covered, so test first.
- We advise you work with Jupyter Notebook, where documentation and code and output are all together in a browser window, and the visualizations are easily rendered. Type in `jupyter notebook` and in some time you'll see it open a tab in your browser. Create a new python3 notebook and you're all set!
